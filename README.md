# 🚀 Basic Rocket Dynamics Simulator

This Python script performs simplified calculations for rocket performance parameters—**velocity**, **altitude**, and **atmospheric temperature**—at a specific point in time after launch.

It uses fundamental aerospace formulas, including the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation for velocity and a simplified constant-acceleration model for altitude.

## 📋 Prerequisites

* **Python 3:** The script requires a standard Python 3 installation.
* **Math Module:** The built-in `math` module is used for the natural logarithm (`math.log`).

## 🛠️ Usage

### 1. Save the Code

Save the corrected Python script (as provided in the previous turn) as a file named `rocket_sim.py`.

### 2. Run the Script

Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run it:

```bash
python rocket_sim.py
